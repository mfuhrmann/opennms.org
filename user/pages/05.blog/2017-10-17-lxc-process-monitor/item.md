Monitoring should always help in bad situations and give a good overview about your system.
Especially service availability monitors are quite handy to ensure that all services are running on the correct machines.

You can find a good use case for service availability monitoring using the example of LXC containers based on [Process monitoring blog](https://opennms.org/en/blog/2017-05-09-process-monitoring-snmp).
