A long time ago...
I got MIB files for Synology NAS devices and wanted to create a monitoring solution.
Unfortunately I didn't have a device.

So I suspended my task for another long time until I finally bought a Synology for private use.
Synology supports the SNMP protocol which made it easy to get some useful status about system health.
Consequent I was able to create some monitors using the [SNMP monitor](http://docs.opennms.org/opennms/releases/latest/guide-admin/guide-admin.html#_snmpmonitor).
